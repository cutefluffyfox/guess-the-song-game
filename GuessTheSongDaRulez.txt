```
A song will be played by Le Voice
Your goal is to find 
- Author of the song             + 1 point
- Title of the song 	         + 1 point
- Who submitted the song to me   + 3 points
- Extra submitter guess          + 3 points if right - 3 points if wrong

A song MIGHT have multiple submitter! but if your guess is wrong, you get -3 points per wrong guesses

- How to play:
The first half of the song's playtime will be hidden by Andr√©'s magnificent art,after which the YouTube video will be revealed (could help you guess better)

- Guessing multiple submitter
if your guess is wrong you will not lose points BUT a song COULD have multiple submitters !

||Yonkagor - Circus Hop - Komider|| 
If you don't know an answer but still want to submit it, add a placeholder character as an answer 
"||? - ? - Le Voice" or "||X - X - SkyfallStar||"
